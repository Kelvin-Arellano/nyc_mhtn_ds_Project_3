    "    For this project we wanted to better predict when someone in Detroit would not only allow their property to fall to blight but also not be compliant with the fines issued afterwards. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    We based this project on a data challange from the Michigan Data Science Team (MDST) and the MIchigan Student Symposium for Interdisciplinary Statistical Sciences (MSSISS). They partnered with the City Detroit to better understand this problem. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Blight, allowing your property to fall into and remain in ruin,  has become a serious problem in Detroit. Every year the city issues millions of dollars in fines to violators and every year many of those tickets go unpaid. Following up and enforcing these fines can become extremely costly as well and as such they want to use predictive analytics to increase ticket compliance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    To answer this question we first needed to understand when and why a resident would not comply with a blight violation. This is the task, understanding the factors that play into that, be they categorical or numerical. \n",
